NAME
    CPAN::Testers - QA of CPAN distributions via cross-platform testing

SYNOPSIS
    With the explosive growth and increased interest in the CPAN Testers, it
    was felt useful to create this namespace placeholder to house the newly
    architected next-generation CPAN Testers stack, which is now in
    development. This namespace also provides for the consolidation of
    related work under one unified and easily identifiable umbrella.
    Co-maint permissions in this namespace are freely granted to anyone
    working on any area of the CPAN Testers infrastructure.

DESCRIPTION
    Started in 1998 by Graham Barr and Chris Nandor, the CPAN Testers exist
    to provide quality assurance of CPAN distributions via cross-platform
    testing with many versions of perl. Some of our goals include the
    increase of portability of CPAN distributions and to provide authors
    with helpful feedback.

    Nowadays, it's quite effortless to get involved--even casually--with
    mature support for CPAN Testing with both CPAN and CPANPLUS. Testing
    methods ranging from manual to automatic are available.

    There are many distributions that comprise the CPAN Testers stack
    (please forgive my poor artwork). The current architecture is as
    follows:

                       [POE-Component-CPAN-YACSmoke]
                                    |
    [cpantest]                      |
        \                    [CPAN-YACSmoke]
         \                     (CPANPLUS)
          \                       /
           \   [CPAN-Reporter]   /
            \      (CPAN)       /
             \       |         /
              \      |        /
               [Test-Reporter]

    Test::Reporter is delivered test report data by one of its upstream
    constituents and then invokes a transport to submit the test report to
    the cpan-testers@perl.org mailing list. The mailing list is the current
    de facto data store for the test reports. From there, web-based
    presentation of the reports are provided courtesy of the
    CPAN-WWW-Testers and CPAN-WWW-Testers-Generator distributions, and
    web-based statistics are provided courtesy of cpanstats
    (http://perl.grango.org/cpanstats-0.29.tar.gz).

    Improvements to this architecture are currently in discussion. Plans for
    abstracting discrete functionality (parsing, grading, transports, etc.)
    into separate distributions within this namespace are in progress.
    Additionally, we are working on an HTTP transport for the submission of
    test reports at the request of the perl.org folks, Adam Kennedy, and
    others.
