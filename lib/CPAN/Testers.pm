CPAN::Testers - QA of CPAN distributions via cross-platform testing

=head1 SYNOPSIS

With the explosive growth and increased interest in the CPAN Testers over the 
first 5 years, it was felt useful to create this namespace placeholder to house
the re-architected next-generation CPAN Testers stack.

This namespace also provides for the consolidation of related work under one
unified and easily identifiable umbrella. Co-maintainer permissions in this
namespace are freely granted to anyone working on any area of the CPAN Testers
infrastructure.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Started in 1998 by Graham Barr and Chris Nandor, the CPAN Testers exist to
provide quality assurance of CPAN distributions via cross-platform testing with
many versions of perl. Some of our goals include the increase of portability of
CPAN distributions and to provide authors with helpful feedback.

Nowadays, it's quite effortless to get involved--even casually--with mature
support for CPAN Testing with both CPAN and CPANPLUS. Testing methods ranging
from manual to automatic are available.

There are many distributions that comprise the CPAN Testers stack (please
forgive my poor artwork). The current architecture is as follows:


                  [POE-Component-CPANPLUS-YACSmoke]
                                  |
   [CPAN-Reporter]      [CPANPLUS-YACSmoke]        [cpanm-reporter]
       (CPAN)                (CPANPLUS)               (cpanminus)
          |                       |                        |
          |                       |                        |

This a rather simplistic view, but covers the basic flow of test reports into
the system, and how the 'cpanstats' database and the core websites are derived.

=head2 Smoke Clients

There are additional smokebot applications that sit beyond the CPAN-Reporter,
CPANPLUS-YACSmoke and cpanm-report smoker clients, though all use the APIs 
provided by these hooks into the three primary distribution installers, CPAN,
CPANPLUS and cpanminus.

Previously there were standalone scripts, such as 'cpantest' included with 
CPANPLUS prior to v0.50, which used dedicated test capture code, specifically
for the purpose of CPAN Testers. As of CPANPLUS-0.50, this code was removed.
In its place a new distribution, CPAN-YACSmoke, was released incorporating
new test capture code utilising the new CPANPLUS API. 

In 2006 CPAN::Reporter was released, providing smoke testing support for 
CPAN.pm.

In 2008, with little work being done to bring CPAN-YACSmoke up to date with
the current CPANPLUS API, CPANPLUS-YACSmoke was released, building on the work
of CPAN-YACSmoke.

In 2010 a new minmal installer was released. In 2013 a parser, cpanm-reporter,
was released that took the output logs from cpanminus and adapted them into 
test reports that could be submitted to the Metabase. All three installers had
their own dedicated smoker clients.

The primary client interfaces for CPAN Testers smoke testing are CPAN-Reporter
and CPANPLUS-YACSmoke, though cpanminus-reporter is still young.

In order to submit reports, the clients need to supply test results in a 
consistent form, so that the data store can parse them and store the relevant 
parts as necessary. The means to provide a consistent API and transport are 
provided by Test-Reporter, which includes the transport methods to submit to 
the appropriate data stores.

=head2 CPAN Testers 1.0

CPAN Testers report submissions began on a mailing list. In the early days 
reports were crafted by hand and sent via a mail client. With the design of
CPANPLUS, an automated tool was written to provide test reports that could then
be edited before sending. The transport mechanism was SMTP, as provided by 
Test-Reporter.

For many years this was adequate, with the SMTP transport layer sending reports
to the cpan-testers mailing list. The perl.org server which received the mails,
then provided a read only NNTP service to view the test reports.

In 2008 the number of testers was increasing, and the submission of reports
were increasing beyond initial expectations, with over 450,000 reports 
submitted in November 2009. The storage mechanism provided by NNTP on the 
perl.org servers, had long reached its limit and was no longer scaling with the 
level of reports being submitted. It was time for a change.

=head2 CPAN Testers 2.0

In 2008 the idea for an alternative storage mechanism for CPAN Testers reports
was mooted at the Olso QA Hackathon. Out of that came an idea now known as the
Metabase. It was the germ of the plan to move CPAN Testers to a HTTP report 
submission system. At the Birmingham QA Hackathon in 2009, work on the Metabase
and a HTTP gateway continued. In December 2009, the perl.org admins gave a 
deadline of 1st March 2010 to switch off SMTP submissions.

Test-Reporter, now provides a delivery mechanism for sending the test report 
data via a HTTP request, using Test::Reporter::Transport::Metabase, into the 
Metabase.

The Metabase is now the CPAN Testers 2.0 centralised data store. The Metabase
currently sits on an Amazon S3 server, and can cope with many more times the 
level of throughput than was previously seen with the SMTP delivery mechanism.

As over 1st September 2010, the old SMTP gateway to the old cpan-testers 
mailing list was closed. 

=head2 The 'cpanstats' Database

The original 'cpantest' Database began life with a parser reading the NNTP 
feed once a day and storing metadata in an SQLite database, freely available
for all to use. 

In 2007 the CPAN Testers Statistics websites extended the parser and created 
the 'cpanstats' database, which contain more information necessary to drive the
statistical analysis. Also initially a SQLite database.

With the overhaul of the CPAN Testers websites in 2008, the 'cpanstats' 
database became the master database. While the SQLite database was still 
updated and provided for use by all, the master database was ported into a
MySQL database, with tables for uploads and further statistical analysis being
added.

The MySQL 'cpanstats' database now provides the following SQLite databases:

=over 4

=item * uploads.db

=item * release.db

=back

The old cpanstats.db SQLite database has now been retired, due to errors 
creating the data with SQLite.

=head2 The Websites

Prior to 2002 the CPAN Testers reports were available in their raw form via the
NNTP server. In 2002 a new site grouped together the list of reports for each
distribution uploaded to CPAN and each CPAN author. 

In 2007 the CPAN Testers Statistics site was launched to provide analysis of 
data regarding reports and to highlight trends in testing.

In 2008, the CPAN Testers websites started receiving an overhaul, with a 
complete facelift being unveiled in May 2009. The two primary websites, the
Reports and Statistics websites are now complimented by the Wiki, Blog, 
Development, Metabase, Dependencies, Matrix and Analysis websites, with the 
'cpanstats' database being used by many other sites for their own data 
analysis.

In 2010 with the launch of CT2.0 the NNTP feed was deprecated. All reports
are now held on the cpantesters server, and can be viewed using their id or
guid in styled or raw formats.

Since 2010, various APIs have been released to enable anyone to get at the
underlying data and reports to present, analyse and store reports as they
wish.

In 2014 the CPAN Testers Admin site was released, to provide authors and 
testers with a means to 'cancel' reports, where the smoker was submitting 
incorrect reports, and also for testers to claim the email addresses they
have and are using. The latter then feeds into the Leaderboard.

Improvements to the CPAN Testers architecture are always in progress.
